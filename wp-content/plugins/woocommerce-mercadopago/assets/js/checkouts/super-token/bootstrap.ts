/**
 * Bundle entrypoint for the refactored Super Token runtime — the only runtime after the cutover.
 * In dev/self-construct mode this file is built locally (build/super-token/bootstrap.ts.js) and
 * enqueued by CustomGateway; in bundle mode it is the single CDN bundle. Emergency rollback is
 * CDN-first (republish the previous bundle), no longer a per-store toggle.
 *
 * This is a thin orchestrator: it wires the three composition concerns and holds no logic itself.
 * Loading it (1) publishes every legacy-delegation seam to window.mpSuperToken* through the
 * transitional bridge so the still-legacy JS classes delegate each orchestration step to the TS use
 * cases, (2) resolves the A/B variant and — once the SDK exists — builds and publishes the stateful
 * runtime instances + saved-methods render, and (3) starts the SDK-readiness/init-health resilience.
 *
 * In the pre-cutover hybrid the legacy `mp-super-token.js` still builds the stateful classes and
 * mirrors them to `window.mpSuperToken*`; the runtime composition reuses those instances through
 * typed session adapters (guarded so it never rebuilds them) and the delegation seams keep a
 * fallback path so stores stay safe if a seam fails.
