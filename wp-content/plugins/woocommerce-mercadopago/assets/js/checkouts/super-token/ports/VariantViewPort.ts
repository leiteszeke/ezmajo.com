/**
 * Port: variant-specific rendering of the saved-payment-methods UI — the seam that
 * differs between A/B variants (today the `v2` and `v2.1` folders). The concrete
 * views live in `adapters/view/{v2,v2.1}` and are resolved once by the
 * `VariantViewFactory` (TASK-008, ADR-005).
 *
 * The seam has four behaviours because v2 and v2.1 diverge at four points of the
 * saved-methods lifecycle: the initial render, the decoration applied when a method
 * is selected, its removal on deselect, and the variant chrome removed on reset. A
 * variant with no behaviour at a given point (e.g. v2 has no account-money
 * decoration) implements it as a no-op, so consumers never branch on the variant.
